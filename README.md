## Projects

### 1. Health Dataset EDA
**Notebook:** `01_health_dataset_eda.ipynb`  
Exploratory data analysis on a public health dataset using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

- Cleaned and summarized key health metrics  
- Visualized feature distributions and relationships  
- Demonstrated structured exploratory workflow for real-world datasets  

### 2. Diabetes Health Indicators
**Notebook:** `Diabetes_health_indicators.ipynb`  
Analysis of behavioral and clinical factors contributing to diabetes risk using CDCâ€™s BRFSS dataset.

- Compared diabetes prevalence across BMI, smoking, and physical activity levels  
- Created clear visualizations of health risk patterns  
- Highlighted relationships useful for preventive healthcare insights  

### 3. Air Quality Trends
**Notebook:** `Air_quality_trends.ipynb`  
Analysis of U.S. air pollution levels (NOâ‚‚, SOâ‚‚, Oâ‚ƒ, and CO) from 2000â€“2016 using EPA data.

- Examined yearly and regional trends in pollutant levels  
- Created visualizations showing long-term declines in air pollution  
- Showcased time-series and grouping analysis using pandas and matplotlib
